# AI-Adventures

- Collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks with AI & ML Algorithms
- Each Notebook contains a basic introduction of the algorithm, an implementation with the Scikit learn library and a scratch implementation with a description focused on the mathematical foundations of the algorithm

# Motivation
This project was born in response to my interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from a deeper mathematical perspective.
